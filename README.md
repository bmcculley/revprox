# revprox

A simple reverse proxy in Go.

I created this because I was running [coder](https://github.com/cdr/code-server) 
on a remote server behind [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) and I'm not aware 
of a way to restrict access to a specific IP address like what is possible 
with [nginx](https://nginx.org/).
